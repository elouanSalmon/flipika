Navigate to the 'Campaigns' tab, adjust your columns to match the template schema (Clicks, Impressions, CTR, Cost, Conversions, Cost/Conv, Conv. Rate), and then click 'Download' > 'Excel .csv'. Open the CSV, copy the data range, and paste it into the 'Raw Data' tab of our template. The formulas in the 'Dashboard' tab will update automatically. Note: You must repeat this process every time you want to refresh the date range."

                    "a": "Yes, it is possible to use Google Apps Script to fetch data, but it requires coding knowledge and maintenance. If Google changes their API, your script will break. This is why professional marketers use dedicated connectors like Flipika, which handles the API maintenance and provides a drag-and-drop interface for building reports."

                    "a": "This usually happens if your 'Cost' is zero, causing a division by zero error. Our template has `IFERROR` wrappers to handle this, but if you are editing the formulas, ensure you validate that the denominator is greater than zero."

Flipika automates this by allowing you to select 'Compare to: Previous Period' in the dashboard settings, instantly generating red/green percentage changes without manual entry."

However, because PMax behaves differently (no keywords), the 'Keyword Analysis' tab will remain empty for those specific campaigns. For detailed PMax reporting (Asset Groups, Listing Groups), we recommend using a specialized tool like Flipika."

Use the 'Executive Summary' slide to highlight Spend, Revenue, and ROAS (Return on Ad Spend). Only dive into campaign-level metrics if asked.
