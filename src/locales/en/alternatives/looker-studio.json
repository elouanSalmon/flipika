    "faq": {
        "q1": "Do I need to pay for BigQuery like with Looker Studio?",
        "a1": "No! Flipika includes its own optimized data storage. You don't need to pay strictly for cloud storage or configure complex BigQuery connectors for speed.",
        "q2": "Can I import my Looker Studio templates?",
        "a2": "Not directly, the architecture is too different. But our template library covers 95% of standard needs, and our editor allows recreating specific views much faster than Looker.",
        "q3": "Are there row limits like Looker's 75k?",
        "a3": "No. Our architecture is built for Big Data. Whether you have 10,000 or 10 million campaign rows, Flipika remains smooth and fast.",
        "q4": "Do I keep my historical access?",
        "a4": "Yes, Flipika retrieves all available history via the Google Ads API (typically several years). You don't lose performance history by switching tools.",
        "q5": "How do you handle Google API quotas?",
        "a5": "That's our strength. Unlike Looker which uses YOUR quota, Flipika uses its own caching and query optimization system. You'll never see a quota error again.",
        "q6": "Is the tool collaborative?",
        "a6": "Yes, much more than Looker. You can comment directly on charts, assign tasks to your team, and finely manage access rights for each user.",
        "q7": "Can I add my logo?",
        "a7": "Absolutely. White Label is native. Your logo, your colors, your domain. Your clients will never see the Flipika brand, unlike the Google banner on Looker reports.",
        "q8": "Is support responsive?",
        "a8": "Yes. No more Google community forums where no one answers. You get real human support via chat, ready to help."
