        "q1": "Can I import my existing Looker Studio dashboards?",

        "q2": "Is Flipika really faster than Looker Studio?",
        "a2": "Yes, significantly. Looker Studio queries the Google Ads API on every load, which takes 10-30 seconds. Flipika pre-calculates your metrics and uses an optimized architecture that loads your reports in under a second, even with millions of data rows.",
        "q3": "Is my data secure?",
        "a3": "Absolutely. Flipika is hosted on Google Cloud (same servers as Google Ads), uses SSL/TLS encryption, and is GDPR compliant. Your data is stored in Europe and never shared with third parties. We have the same security standards as online banks.",
        "q4": "Can I customize reports to my brand?",
        "a4": "Yes, completely. You can upload your logo, define your brand colors, customize displayed metrics, and even use your own domain (e.g., reports.youragency.com). White label is included in all plans.",
        "q5": "How does migration work?",
        "a5": "Our team supports you for free. Send us your current Looker Studio dashboard links, we analyze them, and create the equivalents in Flipika. Typical migration: 1-2 days for 10-20 dashboards. You validate, and we launch.",
        "q6": "What happens if Google Ads changes their API?",
        "a6": "Unlike Looker Studio where you have to manually reconfigure everything, Flipika automatically handles Google Ads API changes. Our technical team maintains the connectors up to date, you don't have to do anything. Zero downtime, zero worries.",
        "q7": "Can I try Flipika without commitment?",
        "a7": "Yes, 100%. All our plans include a 14-day free trial, no credit card required. You can create as many reports as you want during the trial. If it doesn't suit you, no problem, cancel with one click.",
        "q8": "Does Flipika work with Google Analytics and Facebook Ads?",
        "a8": "Flipika is currently specialized in Google Ads to offer the best possible experience. Google Analytics 4 and Meta Ads integrations are in development and will launch in Q2 2026. Subscribe to our newsletter to be notified of the launch."
