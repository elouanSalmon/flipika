      "a1": "You get 14 days of full access after entering your payment details. Connect your Google Ads accounts and generate unlimited reports. You won't be charged during the trial period.",
      "q2": "What counts as a \"Google Ads account\"?",
      "a2": "Each Google Ads account (MCC sub-account or standalone) that you connect to Flipika counts as one seat. You only pay for accounts you actively connect.",
      "q3": "Can I cancel anytime?",
      "a3": "Yes, absolutely. You can cancel your subscription at any time from your billing settings. You'll keep access until the end of your current billing period.",
      "q4": "What's included in the Lifetime plan?",
      "a4": "The Lifetime plan gives you permanent access to all current and future features, unlimited accounts, and priority support. One payment, no recurring fees, ever.",
      "q5": "Will the Lifetime plan price increase?",
      "a5": "Yes. The current price is a special early adopter offer. As we add more features, the price will increase. Lock in the current price while it lasts.",
      "q6": "How does billing work if I add or remove accounts?",
      "a6": "Your monthly bill adjusts automatically. Add accounts and pay more, remove accounts and pay less. It's prorated so you're always charged fairly.",
      "q7": "Is my payment data secure?",
      "a7": "Absolutely. All payments are processed by Stripe, a PCI-DSS Level 1 certified payment provider. We never store your credit card information.",
      "q8": "Do you offer refunds?",
      "a8": "We offer a full refund within the first 30 days of any paid subscription if you're not satisfied. For the Lifetime plan, the same 30-day guarantee applies."
