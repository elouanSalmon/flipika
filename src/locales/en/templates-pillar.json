        "q2": "Can I export the report to PDF?",
        "a2": "Absolutely. While we encourage live sharing to benefit from interactivity and real-time data, you can generate a pixel-perfect PDF report in one click. The PDF includes all your charts, tables, and branding. Perfect for client presentations or archives.",
        "q3": "How does Flipika connect to my Google Ads account?",
        "a3": "We use the official Google Ads API with OAuth 2.0. It's the same security protocol as Gmail or Google Drive. The connection is read-only: we NEVER modify your campaigns, budgets, or bids. We just visualize performance. You can revoke access anytime from your Google account.",
        "q4": "Is it better than Looker Studio?",
        "a4": "Looker Studio is powerful but slow (10-15s loading time) and hard to maintain (connectors that disconnect). Flipika is built for speed (< 1s loading) and premium aesthetics. If you want client-ready reports without technical headaches, Flipika is better. If you need ultra-custom BigQuery queries, Looker Studio remains relevant.",
        "q5": "Is my data secure?",
        "a5": "Yes. We use SSL/TLS encryption for all communications, store your data on SOC 2 certified servers, and comply with European GDPR. Your Google Ads data is never shared with third parties. We don't sell data. You own your information and can request deletion anytime.",
        "q6": "Can I customize the displayed metrics?",
        "a6": "Totally. Our templates are starting points, not cages. You can add/remove any Google Ads metric: Quality Score, Impression Share, Conv. Rate, Cost/Conv, etc. Drag-and-drop interface to reorganize your widgets. Save your custom templates and reuse them for other accounts.",
        "q7": "Does Flipika work with Google Analytics and other tools?",
        "a7": "Currently, Flipika focuses on Google Ads to offer the best possible experience. Google Analytics 4, Meta Ads, and LinkedIn Ads integration is on our 2026 roadmap. If you need a multi-source dashboard today, we recommend combining Flipika (for Google Ads) with another tool for other platforms.",
        "q8": "How long does it take to create my first report?",
        "a8": "Less than 3 minutes. Here's the process: (1) Connect your Google Ads account via OAuth (30 seconds), (2) Choose a pre-configured template (15 seconds), (3) Customize your branding and colors (2 minutes), (4) Share the link or configure auto-send (30 seconds). That's it. Most users have their first dashboard operational in under 5 minutes."
